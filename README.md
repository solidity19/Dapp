# Dapp
1) We need VSCode editor, Remix , NodeJS, Metamask
2) Write the solidity code in .sol file(copy and past the code present in .sol code in your solidity file present in remix)
3) compile and run the code with out any errors
4) After deployment contrate address will generate, copy that address just keep in save .
5) install VSCode editor
6) create one file and install the npm.
7) Write index.html, index.js and server.js(this server file helps you to run the code in local server for testing)
8) In index.js file we need to give contractAddress , this address already generated after the smartcontract deployment. Need to give that saved address in this file.
9) Change the ABI in index.js
10) then run the local server in your terminal after that we can check by clicking the server link.
    My local server link http://localhost:3300/
11) Before doing all this in .sol file we can check the functionality , working fine or not . If everything works then we can develop the Front end.
12) After deploying the smartcontract we can set the same and we can get the name for different address and we can check weather our smartcontract is accepting the same name or not.
